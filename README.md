This is Christina Gao and Brandon Lee's CS50 final project.

The map is centered around Harvard Yard. 

Left-click on the screen and a blue pushpin will be our designated click marker. You can use the menu at the top of the screen to add an event.

Added it wrong? Misspelled something? Not to worry! You can delete a marker, and see other event info, by left-clicking on a marker.
